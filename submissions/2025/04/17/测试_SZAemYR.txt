My Pet

I have a lovely pet. It is a white cat. Her name is Snowball. She is two years old.

Snowball has soft fur and bright blue eyes. She likes to play with yarn balls. Every morning, she sits by my bed and meows softly. I give her milk and fish for breakfast. After school, we play together in the garden. Sometimes she climbs trees, but she always comes back to me.

I love Snowball very much. She is like a little sister to me. Taking care of her makes me happy!
